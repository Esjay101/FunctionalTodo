# FunctionalTodo

This project is a semi-completed website which uses React, Vue, Node and MongoDB to allow users to create items in a "todo list"
and store them for later access. As of this moment, it lacks account functionality that allows for real user accounts,
however the username function allows the program to siphon only that username's todo items to them.
